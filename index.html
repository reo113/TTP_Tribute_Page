        <p id="tribute-info">In my most irritable yet charming Shrek voice:

            "Listen here, ya pint-sized intruder! This here swamp is mine, and I've had enough of your meddling! So
            gather up your itty-bitty courage and skedaddle out of my beloved domain. This ain't no place for
            fancy-pants city folk or curious wanderers. I've got mud to wallow in, bugs to chat with, and onions to
            peel!

            <a href="" id="tribute-link" target="_blank">You think you can just waltz into my swamp</a>, disturbing the peace and tranquility? Well, think again! This
            ain't no tourist attraction or picnic spot. It's a sanctuary for ogres like me, and I don't take kindly to
            uninvited guests.

            Now, grab your map, retrace your steps, and march yourself outta here. Don't even think about leaving a
            trace behind, 'cause I got a keen nose for intruders. And trust me, you won't like what happens if I catch
            you lingering.

            So, don't test my patience, little human. The swamp is off-limits to the likes of you. The sooner you're
            outta here, the better for both of us. And don't even think about coming back unless you bring some
            donkey-approved snacks!

            Now scram! And don't let the door hit ya on the way out... if there was a door, which there ain't 'cause
            this is my swamp!"</p>
